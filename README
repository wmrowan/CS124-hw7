Our Reordering Algorithm
------------------------

To reorder the output of the unigram translation algorithm in order to
produce better constructed English. We successively apply a number of simple
rules that reorder, change, and sometimes add or subtract words.

The first of these is called AdjectiveBeforeNoun and simply swaps any noun
adjective pairs where the adjective follows the noun. This is done iteratively
within the sentence so that each noun will end up being pushed to the back of
any sequence of consecutive adjectives that follow it.

The intuition for this is simple. In English adjectives always proceed the noun
they modify while in French they often follow.

The next is called AdverbAfterVerb. This swaps any adverb verb pair so that the
adverb follows the verb. Based on the original unigram output we discovered
that while English adverbs may appear almost anywhere in the sentence, they
often sat awkwardly right in front of the verb in our unigram translation.

Even more errors seem to come out of direct object placement. In the French
source, the direct objects frequently came before the verb so that we ended up
with a subject-object-verb pattern. English, of course, always follows a
subject-verb-object pattern. Unfortunately, it was difficult to come up with a
rule that could fix this problem consistently. Because our direct objects were
marked the same as the subject by the POS tagger, it is almost impossible to
tell if a given noun is the direct object or part of the subject. The best
heuristic we were able to come up with involved looking for a string of nouns
followed by a verb. This is the basis of the DOAfterVerbs rule which switches
the last noun and the verb in these cases, assuming that the noun preceeding
the verb is the direct object.

Next, we note that English verbs require a "to" helper word when in their
infinitive form. The unigram model tranlation model is unable, by itself to
determine when this is necessary. Therefore, we have another rule
InfinitiveVerbs that inserts the "to" whenever we see a preposition followed by
a verb or two verbs in a row.
